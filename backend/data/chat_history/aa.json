It’s your brain’s way of signaling that something needs attention.\n\n2. **Split the situation into two parts**  \n   - **What if you solve it?**  \n     *You’ll feel more in control, gain confidence, and create clear next steps.*  \n   - **What if you don’t solve it right now?**  \n     *You can still explore other options—there are plenty of paths that fit your skills and interests.*\n\n3. **Build a backup plan**  \n   - List a few alternative careers or side projects you could pursue if your first choice stalls.  \n   - Keep the list realistic and actionable (e.g., “take an online course in X,” “network with Y professionals,” “apply to 3 new roles per month”).\n\n4. **Start with the simplest task**  \n   - Pick one tiny action that moves you forward—maybe update your résumé, send a thank‑you email, or research a skill you’re curious about.  \n   - If it feels heavy, break it down further (e.g., “write one sentence about my experience” instead of “update the whole résumé”).\n\n5. **Create emotional safety**  \n   - Talk to a trusted friend or mentor about your fears; sharing often lightens the load.  \n   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel uncertain—many people share this feeling.\n\n6. **Take a calming pause**  \n   - Breathe deeply: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4.  \n   - Reflect on one thing you’ve already achieved; this helps ground you in reality.\n\n7. **Repeat and build momentum**  \n   - After completing each small step, celebrate the win.  \n   - Gradually add a bit more challenge as you feel comfortable.\n\nRemember, you’re not bound to a single path, and each small action brings you closer to clarity. If the anxiety feels too intense, consider speaking with a career counselor or therapist—they can offer tailored support. You’ve got this",
