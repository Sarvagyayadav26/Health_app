Since they're using a mental health assistant, maybe they're feeling down or need someone to talk to.\n\nI should start with a greeting and show empathy. Maybe ask how they're doing. Keep it simple and open-ended to encourage them to share more if they want. Let them know I'm here to listen without judgment.\n\nAlso, if they mention anything serious, I should suggest professional help. But right now, just a casual check-in. Use a warm tone, maybe some emojis to keep it approachable. Make sure the response is concise and not too long.\n</think>\n\nHi there! 😊 How are you feeling today? I'm here to listen if you'd like to share anything—good or bad days are both okay. Just take a deep breath and start where you are.",

    "content": "Career anxiety is a common feeling—your brain is just trying to keep you safe. Here’s a simple, step‑by‑step way to start easing it:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the anxiety**  \n   - It’s natural; you’re not alone.  \n   - Notice the thoughts: “I’ll fail” or “What if I’m abandoned?” and label them as worries, not facts.\n\n2. **Create a backup plan**  \n   - List 2–3 alternative career paths or skill sets you could pivot to if the current one feels too risky.  \n   - Keep the list realistic and actionable (e.g., take an online course, volunteer, network in a related field).\n\n3. **Focus on the simplest action**  \n   - Pick one tiny step that moves you toward your goal (e.g., update your résumé, send one networking email, read a 10‑minute article).  \n   - If that feels hard, break it further: write the subject line first, then the body.\n\n4. **Build momentum**  \n   - Celebrate each small win—check it off a list, give yourself a brief reward.  \n   - As confidence grows, gradually tackle slightly larger tasks.\n\n5. **Address the fear of abandonment**  \n   - Communicate openly with a trusted friend or mentor about how you’re feeling.  \n   - Remind yourself that most people experience similar doubts; you’re not alone.\n\n6. **Practice calm responses**  \n   - When a stressful thought pops up, pause, breathe 4‑4‑4, and choose a rational reply (“I’ll handle this one step at a time”).  \n\n**Quick safety note:** If anxiety feels overwhelming or interferes with daily life, consider reaching out to a mental‑health professional for support. You deserve help and encouragement.",
