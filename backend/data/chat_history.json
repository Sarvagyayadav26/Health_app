    "content": "### Understanding Career Anxiety  \nCareer anxiety is a common, normal reaction to the many uncertainties that come with work life—job changes, promotions, performance expectations, or the fear of making the “wrong” choice. It can show up as:\n\n- **Physical symptoms**: racing heart, headaches, trouble sleeping  \n- **Cognitive symptoms**: “What if I fail?”, “I’m not good enough”  \n- **Behavioral symptoms**: procrastination, avoidance of decision‑making, over‑planning, or, conversely, impulsive moves\n\nRecognizing that these feelings are not a sign of weakness but a signal that something needs attention is the first step toward turning anxiety into action.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pinpoint the Root Causes\n\n| Common Cause | Typical Signs | Quick Check |\n|--------------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Uncertainty about the future** | “I’m not sure what I want to do next” | Ask: What is the most pressing question that keeps you up at night? |\n| **Fear of failure or criticism** | Avoiding new projects, over‑checking work | Reflect: How many times have you avoided a task because of fear? |\n| **Skill mismatch** | Feeling underprepared or overqualified | List: Which skills do you lack? Which you have in abundance? |\n| **Work‑life imbalance** | Exhaustion, lack of personal time | Rate your daily energy on a 1‑10 scale. |\n| **External pressure** (family, finances, culture) | “I must succeed to satisfy others” | Identify the primary source of pressure. |\n| **Lack of direction** | “I’m not sure where I’m headed” | Write a 3‑sentence vision of where you want to be in 1‑3 years. |\n\n**Action:** Pick the top 2‑3 that resonate most. They’ll guide the next steps.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Concrete, Step‑by‑Step Action Plan\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It"

Let me start by breaking down the query.\n\nFirst, the user's message is very brief. They might be testing the system or just starting a conversation. The rules say I need to explain the user's issue in simple words. But since they only said \"hi\", there's no clear issue mentioned. Maybe they're feeling anxious or unsure about how to proceed? It's a stretch, but I should consider that they might need help with something mental health-related.\n\nNext step is to say, \"I don’t have a solution yet. Try consulting a doctor until we find one.\" The user might not have mentioned a specific problem, so I shouldn't make assumptions. The key here is to follow the rules exactly and not add any extra advice. I need to avoid hallucinating solutions. The response should be supportive and encourage them to consult a professional. \n\nI should check if there's any retrieved document content that applies here. Since the user hasn't provided any specific information, maybe the documents suggest a standard response for initial greetings. Wait, the instructions mention using the retrieved documents, but in this case, there's no content provided. Hmm. The user might have expected a different approach, but according to the rules, I have to stick to the given instructions. \n\nAlso, the tone needs to be empathetic and supportive. \"Hi\" is a simple greeting, so the response should be welcoming but also direct them towards professional help. I should make sure not to offer any solutions beyond what's specified. \n\nLet me structure the response: first, a simple explanation of the user's issue. Since they said \"hi\", maybe the issue is that they're seeking help but haven't specified their problem. So I can say something like, \"It sounds like you might be reaching out for support with something on your mind.\" Then follow with the required statement about consulting a doctor. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to first explain the user's issue in very simple words. But the user hasn't mentioned an issue. Maybe the assistant is supposed to infer that a greeting like \"hi\" could indicate the user is in need of assistance but hasn't specified. So the explanation would be that the user is initiating a conversation possibly to seek help. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\n1.

It suggests breaking the problem into two parts: solving it or not solving it, and thinking of solutions for both. Then, it advises starting with a backup plan, considering alternatives, and focusing on small tasks to build momentum.\n\nSection 37 mentions that career anxiety might stem from fear of abandonment or emotional inconsistency. It recommends breaking thoughts into what the heart fears versus reality, creating emotional security through communication and self-reassurance, and taking calming steps like breathing and reflecting.\n\nSection 2 talks about social anxiety, which is similar in that it's a natural response. It suggests breaking social situations into positive and negative outcomes to reduce fear. The \"safe-start plan\" involves low-pressure interactions and gradual exposure.\n\nThe user wants a helpful answer based on these sections. I need to start with a summary, then actionable steps. The answer should be empathetic, concise, and use bullet points where possible.\n\nLet me structure the answer. Start with a summary that normalizes anxiety as a natural part of evolution. Then outline steps: acknowledge anxiety as a signal, create backup plans, break tasks into small steps, challenge fears with reality, and use calming techniques. Also, mention the safe-harbor part if needed.\n\nWait, the documents mention breaking into two verticals (solve vs. not solve), backup plans, small tasks. Also, from section 37, emotional security and calming steps. Maybe combine these points. Need to make sure each step is clear and actionable. Also, note that social anxiety part is relevant if the user's career anxiety includes social aspects.\n\nCheck if all the key points are covered. Yes, breaking into scenarios, backup plans, small steps, emotional security, calming steps. Also, mention that it's not a flaw and that gradual exposure helps. Maybe include the idea of micro-wins from section 2.\n\nMake sure to keep the tone supportive and empathetic. Use phrases like \"It's okay to feel this way\" and \"You're not alone.\" Also, remind them that alternatives exist and that progress is possible with consistent effort.\n\nAvoid any potentially harmful advice.

Let me look at the retrieved documents to form a helpful answer.\n\nFirst, in section 1 of career-studies.txt, it says anxiety is natural and part of evolution. It's about unresolved problems needing a step-by-step approach. The document breaks down career anxiety into considering what happens if you solve the problem versus not solving it. It suggests starting with a backup plan and then focusing on the main plan by breaking tasks into smaller steps.\n\nSection 37 mentions that career anxiety can come from fear of abandonment or inconsistency. It advises breaking thoughts into what the heart fears versus reality, creating emotional security through communication and self-reassurance, and taking calming steps like breathing.\n\nSection 2 talks about social anxiety but the principles might overlap. It emphasizes that anxiety is a protective system, not a flaw. The approach of breaking situations into two sides (positive and negative outcomes) and creating a safe-start plan with low-pressure interactions could be adapted for career anxiety.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should start by normalizing anxiety as an evolutionary tool. Then outline actionable steps: considering both solving and not solving the problem, developing backup plans, breaking tasks into smaller steps, addressing fears with reality checks, and building confidence through small actions. Also, include emotional security strategies like self-communication and calming techniques.\n\nNeed to make sure the answer is empathetic, concise, and uses bullet points for clarity.

Here’s how to address it with actionable steps:\n\n1. **Acknowledge anxiety as a survival tool**  \n   Anxiety signals that your brain is trying to solve a problem. It’s not a flaw—it’s your mind’s way of preparing for challenges.\n\n2. **Break the problem into two scenarios**  \n   - *What if I solve the problem?* Focus on actionable steps toward your main career goal. Start with the **simplest task** (e.g., researching one job, updating a resume).  \n   - *What if I don’t solve it?* Create **backup plans** (e.g., alternative careers, skill-building steps). There are always paths forward.\n\n3. **Address fears with reality checks**  \n"

Knowing you have choices reduces fear of failure.  \n- **Break tasks into tiny steps**: Focus on your main goal, but start with the *simplest action* (e.g., researching one job, updating a resume section). Progress builds confidence.  \n- **Balance fear with facts**: Write down *“What my heart fears”* vs. *“What reality shows”*. For example, fear: “I’ll fail”; reality: “Many people pivot careers successfully.”  \n- **Practice small wins**: Begin low-pressure interactions (e.g., networking messages, informational interviews).

They've previously received advice on breaking problems into scenarios, planning alternatives, and taking small steps.

For example, starting with low-pressure career-related actions.\n\nI should remind them that having anxiety isn't a weakness.

Knowing you’re not limited to one path eases pressure.  \n- **Start tiny**: Focus on the *simplest action* toward your goal (e.g., researching one job, updating a resume section). Progress—even small—builds confidence.  \n- **Prepare for uncertainty**: Practice low-stakes steps first (e.g., networking messages, informational interviews).
